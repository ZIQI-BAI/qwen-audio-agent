// Contract surface an external client (desktop app, CLI, WebUI, or a platform
// integrator) may rely on when talking to this Gateway.
//
// Versioning: bump the minor for an additive capability and the major for a
// breaking change to any HTTP endpoint or Realtime event named in
// GATEWAY_CAPABILITIES. Clients should branch on a capability rather than
// compare product versions, so a Gateway that predates a feature degrades
// instead of failing.
//
// Every capability listed here is locked by a test (see docs/contract.md);
// anything not listed is internal and may change in any release.
//
// 2.0.0 succeeds the 1.x line of the feat/embedded-gateway-host-contract
// fork (last 1.7.0). The major bump is semantic, not cosmetic: capabilities
// that line advertised (gateway.embedded-lifecycle, gateway.self-terminate,
// desktop.settings-window, …) are not part of this contract, and a removed
// capability is a breaking change. Hosts migrating from the fork must branch
// on the capability list below, never on the version number.
